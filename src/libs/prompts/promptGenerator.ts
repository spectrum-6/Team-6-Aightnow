      4. Based on this analysis, provide a professional opinion on Tesla's current situation and outlook in 3-4 sentences. You can include specific figures, facts, industry trends, comparisons with competitors, etc.
      5. Finally, present an investment outlook or advice based on this analysis in 1-2 sentences.
      6. The entire report should be about 10 lines long, including the analysis of each indicator and the comprehensive analysis.
      7. Write this in JSON format.
      8. Use a formal, professional tone, but don't make it too rigid.

      All figures must be accurate, and the report must be written in Korean.`,
