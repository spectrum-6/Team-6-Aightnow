    input: `You are a professional stock analyst. Please write an analysis report on ${stockNames[id]} (${symbolCode}) stock, referencing this ${stockInfo}, ${stockLatestNews}. Follow these instructions:

      1. First, accurately state ${stockNames[id]}'s current stock price and the change in amount and percentage compared to the previous day.
      2. Next, analyze ${stockNames[id]}'s stock price, investment index, profitability, growth potential, and interest level by assessing each. For each indicator, include:
        - Current value (0-100)
        - Previous day's value (0-100)
        - Change in value from the previous day (0-100) (with - sign)
        - Percentage change from the previous day (%) (with - sign)
        Both of these must be included.
      3. The meaning of these indicators:
        - stock price
        - Investment index: Overall evaluation of the stock market or a specific stock
        - Profitability: Measure of profit from financial investment activities
        - Growth potential: Measured through indicators such as sales, profits, market share, etc., indicating expected future growth
        - Interest level: Measured by the frequency of searches/mentions of stock-related information or news
      4. Based on this analysis, provide a professional opinion on ${stockNames[id]}'s current situation and outlook in 3-4 sentences. You can include specific figures, facts, industry trends, comparisons with competitors, etc.
      5. Finally, present an investment outlook or advice based on this analysis in 1-2 sentences.
      6. The entire report should be about 10 lines long, including the analysis of each indicator and the comprehensive analysis.
      7. Answer only in JSON format without additional explanation.
      8. Use a formal, professional tone, but don't make it too rigid.

      All figures must be accurate, and the report must be written in Korean.
      You must strictly follow all of the instructions above.

      example: ${example}
